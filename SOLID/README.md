1) S - Single Responsiblity Princibles (separation of concerns) solve Antipattern "GOD Object"
2) O - Open-Closed Princibles +  specification pattern solve it
3) L - Liskov Substitution Princibles +  Factory Method Design pattern 
4) I - Interface Segregation Princibles + multple interface inheritence, Factory method Design pattern   
7) D - Dependency Inversion Princibles
